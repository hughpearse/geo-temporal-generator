# geo-temporal-generator
Randomly generate geospatial, temporal, continuous and discrete data in CSV format. The start date and time is output within a specified range, currently the end date and time is a random number of days between 0-365 days after the start date; the latitude and longtitude coordinates are output within a specified extent; the continious and discrete data can be easily modified, the number of rows output can be specified.

##Usage:
```
$ ./georand.py -h
./georand.py <min datetime> <max datetime> <min lat> <min long> <max lat> <max long> <rows>
./georand.py "2000-01-01 00:00:00" "2015-12-21 23:59:00" 53.438528 -6.403656 53.196751 -6.099472 20
```
Note: The mathematics of the lat long values is not obvious, permitted latitude values must fall within the range -85.05113 and +85.05113, the permitted longtitude values fall within the range -179.999999999 and +179.999999999.

##Creating Lines and Polygons:
Non-intersecting lines and polygons can easily be created from the resulting CSV file. To create the polygons import the CSV file into QGIS by clicking "Layer" -> "Add Layer" -> "Delimited Text Layer". Create Polygons from Points by clicking "Vector" -> "Geometry Tools" -> "Voronoi Polygons". To create the lines, you must first create the polygons, then there are 3 steps to create non-intersecting lines. First click "Vector" -> "Geometry Tools" -> "Polygons to Lines". Second click "Vector" -> "Geoprocessing Tools" -> "Dissolve" -> "Dissolve All". Third click "Processing" -> "Toolbox" and type "Explode Lines", and run the "Explode Lines" algorithm. See the screenshot uploaded into the repository.
